# Challenge 5 - Building Models in Azure Machine Learning AutoML

## Prerequisites

1. [Challenge 4 - Building Machine Learning in Power BI](./04-PowerBIAutoML.md) should be done successfully.

## Introduction
Adventure Works marketing team loves the insights they've been getting from the Bike Buyer predictive model.  They love it so much, they'd like to apply it more broadly and use it from other systems.  Since the current model can only be used by Power BI, you've been asked to help Adventure Works recreate the model for use outside of Power BI.  For our first step into this process craft an AutoML run, deploy the best model to and endpoint, and finally use that endpoint back in Power BI.

## Success Criteria
1.  A published BikeBuyer model endpoint hosted in Azure ML using AutoML.
1.  Demonstrate usage of the API.
1.  Create a new dataflow in Power BI to leverage the published API.


## Hints
1. None
