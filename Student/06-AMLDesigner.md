# Challenge 6 - Building Models in Azure Machine Learning Designer

## Prerequisites

1. [Challenge 5 - Building Machine Learning in Power BI AutoML](./05-AMLAutoML.md) should be done successfully.

## Introduction

Now that we have created an an AutoML model in the Azure Machiene Learning Service and deployed the trained model to an endpoint, we understand the process of model creation, we can explore another low-code approach of building machine learning models using the Azure Machine Learning Studio Designer.

## Success Criteria
1.  A published BikeBuyer model endpoint hosted in Azure ML
1.  Demonstrate usage of the API
1.  Create a new dataflow in Power BI to leverage the published API

## Hints

1.  Have a closer look at the columns in BikeBuyerTraining and Prospective Buyer.  What is different about these two tables?  Are there any differences that could be preventing you from using your model?
1.  If you don't want to write code to call the REST API, Postman is a great tool. (http://getpostman.com)
